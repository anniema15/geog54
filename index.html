  <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px">Mountaintop removal mining is a coal mining process that removes the surface of mountains to allow access to the coal seams that run along ridges. Explosives are used to blast the top layer, known as the overburden, off to allow access to the coal. It is practiced in the United States throughout the Appalachian Mountain Range. It irreversably changes the topography of the region, which has effects on the vegetation, animal life, water flows, and soil of the region. In many places, entire sections of the Appalachian range have been flattened out. But companies tend to favor the process because it is cheaper and less high risk than underground mining, requiring fewer employees to generate the same output.</p> 

  <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px">In West Virginia, the coal industry has formed the backbone of the state's economy. At its peak, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/04/19/coal-industry-energy-fallout/82972958/">over 178,300 </a> were employed in the coal industry. But the reliance on coal is fading, with just over 50,000 jobs per year in recent measures. President Donald Trump promised to bring back coal jobs and revitalize the industry during the 2016 campaign, hinting at deregulating the mining industry with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/us/politics/trump-clean-water-epa.html">fewer clean water restrictions.</a></p>

  <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px"> Coal has long been linked to diseases in miners like <a href="http://www.npr.org/series/156453033/black-lung-returns-to-coal-country">black lung</a>, which is caused by inhaling the dust that hangs in mine shafts. Recent research seems to indicate that coal mining's health effects seep beyond the mine sites, a phenonmenon that is turning into a growing public health crisis in the Appalachian regions that have long relied on coal for their economy. If unregulated, larger-scale coal mining could further endanger the region's health as particulates and carcinogens more freely enter surrounding water supplies and pollute the air.

  <p>The Last Mountain (2011), a documentary about mountaintop-removal mining, gave some startling statistics about the health of people near mountaintop removal mine sites. while the national average for brain tumors was 1/100,000 people, a small town in West Virginia under a Massey Energy mountaintop mine had 6 deaths from brain tumors within years, all neighboring each other. It was suggested that their well water, contaminated with heavy metals spread through the blasting dust from the mine, was the cause.

  <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px"> In this project, we mapped the incidence of brain and other nervous system cancers and lung disease by county in West Virginia. We also show the location of mines in the state to illustrate how proximity correlates with disease. The project also includes two 3-dimensional models of how the landscape has changed near Coal River Mountain. Viewers can see for themselves how the mountain range has flattened as a result of mountaintop removal mining in the state.
