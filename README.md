# Geography 54 Final Project
Mountaintop removal mining is a coal mining process that removes the surface of mountains to allow access to the coal seams that run along ridges. Explosives are used to blast the top layer, known as the overburden, off to allow access to the coal. It is practiced in the United States throughout the Appalachian Mountain Range. It irreversably changes the topography of the region, which has effects on the vegetation, animal life, water flows, and soil of the region. In many places, entire sections of the Appalachian range have been flattened out. But companies tend to favor the process because it is cheaper and less high risk than underground mining, requiring fewer employees to generate the same output.

In this project, we mapped the incidence of brain and other nervous system cancers and lung disease by county in West Virginia. We also show the location of mines in the state to illustrate how proximity correlates with disease. The project also includes two 3-dimensional models of how the landscape has changed near Coal River Mountain. Viewers can see for themselves how the mountain range has flattened as a result of mountaintop removal mining in the state.

This site uses GIS methods and the Google Maps API to visualize the spatial relationships between disease and mountaintop removal mining. Users can toggle between KML layers to see the overlap in the incidence of disease and the prevalance of mountaintop removal mining.
